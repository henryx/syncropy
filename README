Syncropy backup system
----------------------

Link: http://code.google.com/p/syncropy


Description:
------------

Syncropy is a backup system for remote machines. It is similar of other systems
(e.g. rsnapshot) but it has some differences

Licence:
--------

Syncropy is released under GPLv2 (see GPL.txt for details)

Features:
---------

It use SSH for check and download data.
It manage four distinct datasets (hour, day, week, month).
It save space with hard link creation.
It save data attribute (owner, group, permission, ACL) into database.

Dependencies:
-------------

 - Python 2.5 or more;
 - Paramiko;
 - PsycoPG;
 - An instance of PostgreSQL.

Installation:
-------------

Just extract code into a directory and use it

Usage:
------

Usage is simpliest:

$ python syncropy.py --cfg=<cfgfile> -h # hour backup
$ python syncropy.py --cfg=<cfgfile> -d # day backup
$ python syncropy.py --cfg=<cfgfile> -w # week backup
$ python syncropy.py --cfg=<cfgfile> -m # month backup

Where <cfgfile> is a file structured like the syncropy.cfg reported in the
archive. Some notes:

 - It is possible to have multiple configuration files, where each file has
   different parameters.
 - While database and general sections are global, it is possible to set any number
   of sections, one per server.

This is an example of configuration file:

[general]
repository = /var/backups/servers

log_file = logfile.log
log_level = INFO

hour_grace = 24
day_grace = 6
week_grace = 4
month_grace = 12

[database]
host = localhost
name = backups
user = sysdba
password = masterkey

[server1]
type = ssh
remote_user = root
remote_password = secret
remote_host = 192.168.1.100
remote_port = 22
path = /home
store_acl = yes

[server2]
type = ssh
remote_user = foo
remote_password = bar
remote_host = 192.168.1.101
remote_port = 49152
path = /home/foo
store_acl = no

Caveats:
--------

Because syncropy use hard links to store its dataset, its use is guaranteed on
linux or unix environments.
